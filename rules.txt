Checkers is played by two players.
Pieces are represented by red and 
orange "O's".
Red opens the game, then players 
alternate their turns.
Randomly determine who gets the 
red pieces first. 

            Move

The pieces always move diagonally 
and single pieces are always 
limited to forward moves.
A piece making a non-capturing 
move may move only one square.

           Capture

To capture a piece of your 
opponent, your piece leaps 
over one of the opponent's pieces 
and lands in a straight diagonal 
line on the other side.
This landing square must be empty.
When a piece is captured, it is 
removed from the board.
Only one piece may be captured in a 
single jump.

    Upgrade a piece to a King

When a piece reaches the furthest 
row, it is crowned and becomes a 
king.
When a piece becomes a king it 
becomes represented by an "X" in a 
slightly altered shade of colour.
Kings are still limited to moving 
diagonally but can move both 
forward and backward.

       End of the Game

A player wins the game when the 
opponent cannot make a move.
This happens because all of the 
opponent's pieces have been captured.
